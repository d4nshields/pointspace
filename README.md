unfortunately, I am going to declare defeat and abandon this project.  The original idea 
involved breaking down the mathematics of higher dimensions into projections onto a composed 
space of singular dimensions.  To use higher-order functions to compose theorems in a space where the 
mathematical relationships between objects would not be constrained by the mathematics, they would be theoretical operands. 
Utilizing the composition of a small number of core concepts: approximation, prediction, and using
priority queuing as a generic abstraction to boost performance.

Now that I have some of the basic data types defined, I am seeing how there are complexities
inherent in composition of higher dimensions.   There's a reason why it is more difficult to 
factor higher degree equations than it is if you stick to linear.  Alas.
